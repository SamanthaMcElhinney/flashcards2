## Takeaways

This application was created using test driven development with Mocha framework and Chai testing library. I was given a spec with prompts to make a working application using modular, reusable code that follows Single Responsibility Principle. I used test driven development with my tests implementing both sad and happy path testing. This forced me to be more intential with my approach. I also used a project board for creating the MVP in less than 2 days. 

## Challenges:

Writing tests to include sad path testing.
Correctly implementing the order of methods for the game to run.
Successfully implementing an additional feature for tracking the user's time to finish the game.
